Hello there! I'm Cheol-Ho Choi.

I recevied my B.S. degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering at Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, Republic of Korea, in 2020, where I was advised by [Prof. Jong-Ryul Yang](https://net10226.wixsite.com/misl/professor){:target="_blank"}. I earned my M.S. degree in Electronic and Electrical Engineering from Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea, in 2022, under guidance of [Prof. Byungin Moon](https://soc.knu.ac.kr/docs/members/professor/){:target="_blank"}.

During my Bacholar's, I held two research roles:
  1. Designed the 2.45-GHz and 5.8-GHz low-noise amplifier (LNA) circuit for Doppler radar sensors.
  2. Developed and implemented the real-time bio-signal detection algorithm for the 2.45-GHz Doppler radar sensor.

In my Master's, I focused on two main research topics:
  1. Designed the FPGA-based real-time stereo vision systems using the traditional approaches for autonomus driving platforms.
  2. Designed the FPGA-based fast object detection systems using machine learning for mobile and autonomus driving platforms.

From Bacholar's to Master's, the developed algorithms were impelemtned using MATLAB and C/C++ programming languages. The FPGA-based systems were implemented using a co-processing architecture designed with programmable logic (PL) and processing system (PS). Some developed systems were also fabricated into ASICs.

Currently, I am a Junior Engineer at Hanwha Systems, Co., Ltd., a leading Korean defense electronics company. In this role, I am reponsible for designing FPGA-based real-time image processors and developing image processing algorithms for infrared image-based object detection systems.
