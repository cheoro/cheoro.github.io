Welcome to my website!
I'm Hyunwoo Oh, an FPGA & SoC Firmwire Engineer at Hanwha Systems, working on thermal image processing systems using infrared focal plane arrays. Currently my work focuses on designing SoC FPGA-based hardware and developing RTOS for Heterogeneous MPSoC.
I was an M.S. student at the Seoul National University of Science and Technology (a.k.a. SEOULTECH), advised by [Prof. Seung Eun Lee](https://soc.seoultech.ac.kr/Professor/Professor.html){:target="_blank"}.
Currently I'm interested in two research subjects.
First one is making every digital hardware designs flexible, applicable for a variety of system constraints. 
Second one is efficiently integrating emerging non-Von Neumann hardwares for parallel processing (PIM, NPU, ...) with conventional general-purpose processors.
Most of my works were implemented on the FPGA, and some of them are designed and fabricated to the ASIC.
