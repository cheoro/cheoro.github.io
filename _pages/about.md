Welcome to my website!
I'm Hyunwoo Oh, an Engineer at Hanwha Systems, working on thermal image processing systems using infrared focal plane arrays. Currently my work focuses on designing SoC FPGA-based hardware and developing RTOS for Heterogeneous MPSoC.

I was an M.S. student at the Seoul National University of Science and Technology (a.k.a. SEOULTECH), advised by [Prof. Seung Eun Lee](https://soc.seoultech.ac.kr/Professor/Professor.html){:target="_blank"}.

Currently I'm interested in two research subjects.
First one is making every digital hardware designs flexible, applicable for a variety of system constraints. 
Second one is efficiently integrating emerging non-Von Neumann hardwares for parallel processing (PIM, NPU, ...) with conventional general-purpose processors.
Most of my works were implemented on the FPGA, and some of them are designed and fabricated to the ASIC.
