Hello there! I'm Hyunwoo Oh.

I earned my M.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from Seoul National University of Science and Technology in 2023, where I was advised by [Prof. Seung Eun Lee](https://soc.seoultech.ac.kr/Professor/Professor.html){:target="_blank"}.

During my Master's, I focused on two main research topics:

1. Designing flexible architectures to incorporate novel standard for real number arithmetic, specifically "posit", into general-purpose processors.
2. Integrating domain-specific hardware for parallel processing into conventional general-purpose processors.

Most of my work was implemented using FPGAs, and some projects were fabricated into ASICs.

Now, I am a Junior Engineer at Hanwha Systems, a leading Korean defense electronics company. In this role, I am responsible for designing SoC FPGA-based image processors and developing RTOS for Heterogeneous MPSoCs. Both of these tasks are related to infrared image processing.
